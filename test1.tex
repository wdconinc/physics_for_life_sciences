\question
A waiter is serving drinks at a seafood restaurant and carrying a tray with a mass $m_1 = 0.500$\,kg. On top of the tray are a bottle and some glasses with a total mass $m_2 = 2.000$\,kg. The waiter pushes up from below with a force $\vec{F}$ with a magnitude of 30.0\,N. You can approximate the gravitational acceleration as $g \approx 10$\,m/s$^2$. You may consider the bottle and glasses as a single object.

\end{multicols}
\begin{parts}
\part[5] What is the acceleration (nagnitude and direction) of the entire tray and its contents?
\begin{solution}[2in]
The total mass of the entire tray and its contents is $m = m_1 + m_2 = 2.500$\,kg. The weight of this total mass is $\vec{W} = m \vec{g} = 25$\,N downwards. The net force $\vec{F}_{net} = \vec{F} + \vec{W}$ is then 5\,N upwards. The acceleration that results from this net force $\vec{F}_{net}$ is then $\frac{F_{net}}{m} = 2.0$\,m/s upwards.
\end{solution}
\part[10] What is the force (magnitude and direction) that the tray exerts on the bottle and glasses?
\begin{solution}[2in]
Since the bottle and glasses with mass $m_2$ are moving upwards with an acceleration of 2.0\,m/s, the net force on the bottle and glasses must be $m_2 a = 4.0$\,N upwards. Since the weight on the bottle and glasses is $\vec{W}_2 = \vec{m}_2 g = 20$\,N downwards, this means that the force from the tray on the bottle and glasses is 24\,N upwards. 
\end{solution}
\part[5] What is the force (magnitude and direction) that the bottle and glasses exert on the tray?
\begin{solution}
The force of the bottle and glasses on the tray is equal and opposite to the force of the tray on the bottle and glasses due to Newton's third law, and therefore 24\,N downwards.
\end{solution}

\question
\begin{multicols}{2}
Chessie is a legendary sea monster said to live in the midst of the Chesapeake Bay. Chessie starts swimming from the Gloucester Point marina and wants to reach Yorktown on the other shore of the York river, directly to the southwest of Gloucester Point. Chessie can swim with a speed of 10.0\,knots (or 10.0 nautical miles per hour) relative to the water. However, the tide is coming in from the Chesapeake Bay and there is a current from the southeast to the northwest with a speed of 8.0\,knots relative to the ground.
\columnbreak

 \includegraphics[width=12em]{Chessie_A_Chesapeake_Bay_Story_Cover_Art}
\end{flushright}
\end{multicols}
\begin{parts}
\part[5] In approximately which of the four cardinal directions with respect to the water must Chessie swim to reach Yorktown?
\begin{solution}[2in]
We start from the relative velocity expression $\vec{v}_{chessie,ground} = \vec{v}_{chessie,water} + \vec{v}_{water,ground}$. Since $\vec{v}_{chessie,ground}$ should be towards the southwest and $\vec{v}_{water,ground}$ is towards the northwest, Chessie will have to swim approximately towards the south.
\end{solution}
\part[10] The distance between the Gloucester Point marina and Yorktown is exactly 2.0 nautical miles. How long does it take Chessie to reach Yorktown?
\begin{solution}[2in]
We start from the relative velocity expression $\vec{v}_{chessie,ground} = \vec{v}_{chessie,water} + \vec{v}_{water,ground}$. We know $|\vec{v}_{chessie,water}| = 10.0$\,knots, $\vec{v}_{water,ground} = 8.0$\,knots to the northwest, and $\vec{v}_{chessie,ground}$ is in the direction southwest. In the vector addition we have a right angle between $\vec{v}_{chessie,ground}$ (southwest) and $\vec{v}_{water,ground}$ (northwest) so we can use the Pythagorean theorem, $|\vec{v}_{chessie,ground}|^2 + |\vec{v}_{water,ground}|^2 = |\vec{v}_{chessie,water}|^2$, to determine $|\vec{v}_{chessie,ground}| = \sqrt{10.0^2 - 8.0^2} = 6.0$\,knots. At a speed of 6.0 nautical miles per hour, it takes Chessie 20 minutes to reach the other shore.

\question
Physics departments often have a Halloween \emph{pumpkin drop}. In this event, physics students drop pumpkins from the roof of their building with a height of 16.0\,m. A student throws a pumpkin with a initial speed of 4.0 m/s at an angle of $60^\circ$ from the vertical. You can approximate the gravitational acceleration as $g \approx 10$\,m/s$^2$.

\begin{parts}
\part[5] What is the maximum height above the ground that the pumpkin reaches before it falls to the ground?
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
We can use the formula $h = y_0 + \frac{v_0^2}{2 g} \sin^2 \theta$ to determine the height the pumpkin will reach when its starting position is $y_0 = 18.0$\,m. In particular, with $\theta = 30^\circ$ the angle with the horizontal, this gives us a maximum height of 18.2\,m.
\end{solution}
\part[5] What is the vertical component of the initial velocity?
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
The angle $\theta = 30^\circ$ is angle with the horizontal, so the vertical component of the initial velocity is $v_{0,y} = v_0 \sin 30^\circ = +2.0$\,m/s.
\end{solution}
\part[5] How long does it take for the pumpkin to reach the ground, starting from the time it is released? You may find the following useful: $10^2 = 100$, $11^2 = 121$, $12^2 = 144$, $13^2 = 169$, $14^2 = 196$, $15^2 = 225$, $16^2 = 256$, $17^2 = 289$, $18^2 = 324$, $19^2 = 361$, $20^2 = 400$.
\begin{solution}[2in]
We start from the vertical motion equation $y = y_0 + v_{0,y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$ where $y = 0$, $y_0 = 18.0$\,m, and $v_{0,y} = 2.0$\,m/s. The equation to solve is then $0 = 16.0\,\hbox{m} + 2.0\,\hbox{m/s}\cdot t - 5\,\hbox{m/s}^2 \cdot t^2$. The solutions to this quadratic equation are $t = \frac{2 \pm 18}{10}$ of which we are interested in the positive solution $t = 2.0$\,s.
\end{solution}
\part[5] What is the vertical component of the velocity on impact?
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
After a time $t = 2.0$\,s the velocity has changed from $v_{0,y} = +2.0$\,m/s to $v_y = v_{0,y} - g t = -18.0$\,m/s. This could have been obtained directly from $v_y^2 = v_{0,y}^2 - 2 g (y - y_0) = 4\,\hbox{m}^2/\hbox{s}^2 - 20\,\hbox{m}/\hbox{s}^2 (-16\,\hbox{m}) = 324\,\hbox{m}^2/\hbox{s}^2$.
\end{solution}
